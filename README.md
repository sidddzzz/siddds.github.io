So you might be wondering what this is and its a life saving website 

First imma reccommed some tactical games

So dont get me wrong gauze is expensive and pricy but yo life means more.
so heres how to use gauze
1.Wash hands and put on disposable, non-latex gloves before touching a dressing or wound.
2.Ensure the pad covers beyond the edge of the wound.
3.Hold the pad by the edges and place it directly on top of the wound.
4.Secure the pad with adhesive tape or a roller bandage.
